        <h2>What Is Solar Energy? How It Is Produced?</h2>
        <p class="h2">Solar energy is a renewable and sustainable source of power that comes from the sun's radiation. It can be harnessed and converted into electricity or thermal energy for various applications. Solar energy is considered clean and environmentally friendly because it does not produce harmful emissions or contribute to air pollution.</p>
        <h2>How Solar Energy Is Produced.</h2>
        <p class="h2">Solar PV technology is the most common way to convert sunlight into electricity.
Solar panels, also known as solar modules, are made up of photovoltaic cells that capture sunlight and convert it into direct current (DC) electricity.
Photovoltaic cells are typically made from semiconductor materials like silicon.
When sunlight hits the PV cells, it excites electrons within the cells, creating an electric current.
Inverters are used to convert the DC electricity produced by solar panels into alternating current (AC) electricity, which can be used to power homes, businesses, and the electrical grid.</p>

        <h1 class="h">HISTORY</h1>
        <p class="h3">The history of solar panels dates back to the mid-19th century when French physicist Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel discovered the photovoltaic effect in 1839. However, it was not until 1954 that Bell Labs in the United States developed the first practical photovoltaic (PV) cell using silicon, ushering in the modern era of solar panels. These early solar cells were inefficient and expensive, primarily used for niche applications. Over the decades, advances in materials and technology led to improved efficiency and affordability. The oil crisis in the 1970s sparked interest in solar power, leading to increased research and development. Today, solar panels are a mainstream and rapidly growing source of clean energy worldwide.</p>
